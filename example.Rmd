I am Rogelio, a future data scientist from the University of Texas at San Antonio, where I am currently a student planning to graduate in Fall 2023.

## Academic Background

- Associates of Science, Laredo College, Laredo, TX
- B.S. Multidisciplinary Studies in Data Science, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX

## Professional Background

My only meaningful work experience was during an internship at ARCATEK (an import and export company), where I actively contributed to various office tasks, which provided me with valuable experience in a professional work environment. My key responsibilities included assisting with basic office tasks, where I showcased strong organizational skills and meticulous attention to detail. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in gathering data from the database and effectively organizing it in Excel. I utilized Excel functionalities such as VLOOKUP to manipulate and analyze data, ensuring precision and generating meaningful insights for the team. Collaborating with colleagues, I helped streamline data management processes, contributing to enhanced efficiency and data integrity within the organization. Throughout my internship, I maintained a proactive and eager-to-learn attitude, consistently seeking additional responsibilities and actively participating in team projects to drive success.

## Experience in R

Besisdes this class, I have only had one more class that dealt with R in my first semester at UTSA.

## Experience with Other Analytic Software

I used Excel in my only meaningful work experience, but I currently know in C and Python. I have used and at least know the basics in:

- SAS
- SQL
